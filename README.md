# Project: 2-D DG-FEM Time domain Analysis of a Waveguide Bend 

Starting from the available 2-D CG FEM frequency domain solver for waveguide problems (Moodle, Waveguide 90° Bend) it is necessary to develop a 2-D DG-FEM time domain solver with a given mesh and geometry. The expected outcomes of the project: 
- Theoretical description of the 2-D DG-FEM in time domain for waveguide 90° bend analysis. 
- Field computation for the first (dominant) even mode at the frequency within the single mode propagation range. 
- Computation of the signal reflection (S11) and transmission (S21) parameters. 
- Ez scalar field plot. 
- H vector field plot. 
- The corresponding Matlab code.
